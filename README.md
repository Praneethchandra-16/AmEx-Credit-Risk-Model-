📌 Project Summary: Credit Risk Modeling – AMEX
This project focuses on building a high-performance machine learning solution to predict credit default risk using real-world, time-series financial data provided by American Express as part of a Kaggle competition.
We processed and engineered over 190 features from 13 months of behavioral and transactional data for 91,000+ unique customers. The goal was to build a model that can help AMEX better identify creditworthy customers, reduce financial risk, and optimize the customer approval process.
🔧 Key Contributions:
•	✅ Handled a large-scale dataset (5.5M+ rows) with efficient chunking
•	✅ Performed missing value treatment, categorical encoding, and temporal aggregation over 12-month periods
•	✅ Engineered features like mean, min, max, and last for numeric time-series variables
•	✅ Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables, generating 45+ new features
•	✅ Built and compared two models: XGBoost and a Neural Network, using extensive grid search
•	✅ Selected the final model based on AUC performance and variance stability across training and test splits
•	✅ Used SHAP values for model explainability and to understand feature contributions to risk prediction
🏆 Results:
•	📈 XGBoost outperformed the Neural Network with the highest AUC across all test samples
•	💡 SHAP revealed that features like P_2_last, D_39_max, and B_1_last played critical roles in risk prediction
📊 Business Impact:
This ML-driven solution enables AMEX (or any credit issuer) to:
•	Make smarter approval decisions
•	Reduce the likelihood of defaults
•	Improve the customer onboarding experience
•	Replace or enhance traditional credit scoring systems with explainable AI
